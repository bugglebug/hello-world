# hello-world
I need to learn this shit. A repository is a single project, it has branches.

Hello World, 

My name is Chris Cheung. I've been through some tough changes this year. I need to find what I'm passionate about that is why I'm learning something new. I hope coding is a fun and exciting way to learn about computers and meet new people.

Cheers,
Chris
